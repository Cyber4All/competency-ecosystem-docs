# Mission
The Competency Ecosystem was designed to support the development of the Competency Constructor. The competency constructor allows educators to visualize their competency statements while they are creating them and then communicates with the Competency Constructor API to store them for easy retrieval. This project began in 2022 and will be continuing through 2024. 

# What is the Competency Constructor API?
The Competency Constructor API provides users with a programmatic way to access competencies built using our structure. You can use the API to build custom integrations with our competency data model or retrieve released and deprecated competencies.
 
{: .note }
Weâ€™ve designed the Competency Constructor API to utilize both REST and GRAPHQL. Both standards are used to return competency resources in JSON format.
